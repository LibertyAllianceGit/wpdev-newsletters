Newsletters | by WPDevelopers
===

Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that allows you to easily embed sign-up forms for the spectrum of services we use for email newsletters. I can easily embed forms for Inbox First, Maxim Tech, and Mail Chimp! In the future I'm going to get spruced up with a beautiful, slick, easy to use admin panel, and I'll include an email builder. All of that is already in the works, but not quite ready for it's debut yet! Stay tuned!

---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Configure via the Newsletters options page in the dashboard.
